# Hello There

I'm Dillon DiPetrillo, I work as a software developer in Tampa, FL. I mainly focus on front-end technologies and applications.

I am currently learning more back-end development and how it works with the front-end. Javascript frameworks like React and Angular are becoming my favorite to work with.

You can contact me via email at dillonrdipetrillo@gmail.com.
